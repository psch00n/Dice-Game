# Dice-Game

Introduction
This project demonstrates how to create a simple electronic dice game using a Raspberry Pi and a breadboard. The device simulates rolling two dice, providing a digital alternative to traditional physical dice. It's an excellent project for beginners learning about Raspberry Pi, GPIO programming, and basic electronics. The electronic dice can be used for board games, educational purposes, or as a fun way to make random selections.
